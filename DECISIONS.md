# Rondo — DECISIONS

This file is the canonical, append-only record of rondo's design decisions.

**The numbering space is rondo's own.** It starts at `D-0001` and has nothing to do with
[`suisya-systems/continuo`](https://github.com/suisya-systems/continuo)'s `D-0001` or
[`suisya-systems/cadenza`](https://github.com/suisya-systems/cadenza)'s, each of which is a
different decision about a different repository. Every reference to a sibling's decision below is
written `continuo D-00NN` or `cadenza D-00NN`, and cadenza's open design rows are cited as
`cadenza C-NN`, so the spaces can never be read as one.

## How to use this file

- **IDs are permanent.** `D-0001` ... are stable identifiers. Once assigned, an ID is never
  reused, renumbered, merged into another entry, or deleted.
- **Supersession keeps the ID.** A decision that stops being true keeps its ID and gains
  `Status: superseded by D-XXXX`; the replacement gets a new ID at the end of the list.
- **Cross-reference by ID only.** Never cite this file by line number, heading order, or table
  position.
- **Every entry states what would falsify it.** A decision taken on facts that can change records
  the fact, the version, and the date it was measured at, so a later reader can tell "still true"
  from "was true in 2026".
- **Belts hold disjoint number ranges**, so concurrent lanes conflict only in the index table above
  and never over an ID. `D-0001`..`D-0099` is the bootstrap band and the shared band for
  cross-belt decisions taken at the window. Later belts allocate their own `D-01xx`, `D-02xx`, ...
  by an entry in this band, as continuo and cadenza do. The ranges are an allocation, not a
  meaning: nothing about an entry follows from which range it is in.

## D-0001 — How rondo consumes continuo and cadenza in lap 1: a CLI process boundary for continuo, and nothing at all for cadenza

**Status:** accepted (2026-09-05, rondo#1)

### Decision

1. **rondo takes no npm dependency on either sibling.** `package.json` has no `dependencies`
   block, and adding one for `@suisya-systems/continuo` or `@suisya-systems/cadenza` — in any
   specifier form — supersedes this entry rather than merely extending it.
2. **continuo is consumed across a CLI process boundary.** A checkout pinned by commit sha, built
   once, and invoked as `node <checkout>/dist/cli.js`. This is `cadenza C-8`'s recommendation for
   the same seam, reached here independently and by measurement.
3. **cadenza is not consumed at all in lap 1.** Nothing in rondo imports it, spawns it, or links
   to it. What rondo needs from cadenza's vocabulary in lap 1 it reaches through continuo or
   restates at its own boundary.
4. **rondo records which continuo revision it drove**, per run, from the sha of the checkout it
   built — because the seam cannot answer that question (see the evidence below). This is
   `cadenza C-14` landing on rondo, and it is a cost of the choice rather than a separate one.

### What was measured, and how

Everything below was run on **2026-09-05** against the two sibling checkouts on `main`, which were
treated as strictly read-only and were verified untouched afterwards (`git status --porcelain` in
both reported only a pre-existing `?? .worktrees/`, and neither acquired a `node_modules/` or a
`dist/`).

```
node --version; npm --version
```
```
v22.17.0
10.9.2
```
```
git -C <workers>/continuo rev-parse HEAD    ->  9212f2b2e6b14fa53f9a8ed378ba6d2529393c1e
git -C <workers>/cadenza  rev-parse HEAD    ->  f8b6696881de94ec13ff0d4a2eb7f16ab65b6796
```

**The baseline that makes any of this necessary.** Neither package resolves on the registry:

```
npm view @suisya-systems/continuo version
```
```
npm error code E404
npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/@suisya-systems%2fcontinuo - Not found
npm error 404  '@suisya-systems/continuo@*' is not in this registry.
```

The same, verbatim, for `@suisya-systems/cadenza`. A scoped `E404` on an unauthenticated client is
also what a *private published* package looks like, so this proves "this client cannot resolve it",
not "it was never published" — operationally the same thing for rondo.

**Neither package has a lifecycle script that would build on install.** This one fact explains most
of what follows:

```
grep -nE '"(prepare|prepack|prepublishOnly|postinstall|install)"' <continuo>/package.json <cadenza>/package.json; echo "grep-exit=$?"
```
```
grep-exit=1
```

**The network is not the blocker.** Both remotes answer an unauthenticated `ls-remote` (exit 0,
with `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=/dev/null` and `GIT_ASKPASS=/bin/true`, and no `insteadOf` rewrite
configured), so every failure below is a packaging failure rather than an access failure.

### Option (a) — an npm git dependency at a pinned commit: **fails for continuo, fails for cadenza**

```
npm install --ignore-scripts "git+https://github.com/suisya-systems/continuo.git#9212f2b2e6b14fa53f9a8ed378ba6d2529393c1e"
```
```
npm warn skipping integrity check for git dependency ssh://git@github.com/suisya-systems/continuo.git

added 6 packages, and audited 7 packages in 14s
```

Exit 0 — and useless. `"files": ["dist", "README.md", "LICENSE"]` was honoured exactly, and `dist`
did not exist at pack time:

```
ls -la node_modules/@suisya-systems/continuo   ->  LICENSE  package.json  README.md
ls -d  node_modules/@suisya-systems/continuo/dist
```
```
ls: cannot access '.../node_modules/@suisya-systems/continuo/dist': No such file or directory
```
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '.../node_modules/@suisya-systems/continuo/dist/index.js'
```

`node_modules/.bin` was not created at all, although the installed manifest still advertises
`bin.continuo` — so an install-then-spawn CI job goes **green on install and dies at spawn**.

The lockfile does record an integrity hash
(`sha512-BEDsSTaL5KzGuK1IUUalGkyW0rmepaZsgTF2TzajBPk284dj2h8Qh4ZpouZgpEZi8pMebJVjq8IPi5HTagAwkg==`,
byte-stable across independent installs of the same sha), but npm prints
`npm warn skipping integrity check for git dependency` on every install: the hash is recorded, not
enforced.

For cadenza the failure is one layer earlier. With no `files` field the install ships the entire
1.7 MB working tree — `src/`, `test/`, `tests/`, `docs/`, `parity/`, a 128 KB `DECISIONS.md`,
`pyproject.toml` — and with no `exports`, `main` or `types`, resolution falls through to legacy
main:

```
Error: Cannot find package '.../node_modules/@suisya-systems/cadenza/index.js'
    at legacyMainResolve (node:internal/modules/esm/resolve:204:26)
  code: 'ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND'
```

Reaching the barrel directly does not rescue it. Node **categorically refuses** to strip types for
any file under `node_modules`, on both legs of rondo's own matrix — `node v22.17.0
--experimental-strip-types` and `node v24.15.0`, where stripping is on by default:

```
ERR_UNSUPPORTED_NODE_MODULES_TYPE_STRIPPING
```

This is worth stating precisely, because the obvious reading is wrong: **no future Node version
rescues cadenza here.** Only a third-party loader does. With `tsx` installed, the deep specifier
`@suisya-systems/cadenza/src/index.ts` both type-checks under TypeScript 7.0.2 with NodeNext and
runs (`ok via .js specifier: 70 exports`), so cadenza is not *impossible* to consume — it is
consumable only by compiling a dependency's source, through an unversioned internal path, behind a
runtime loader. That is a dependency rondo declines to take, not one it cannot take.

**The one-line diagnosis — and why it is not an escalation.** On a throwaway clone of continuo in
scratch — the real checkout untouched — adding `"prepare": "npm run build"` and installing that
copy as a git dep produced `dist/`, a resolvable bare import with 814 named exports,
`dist/index.d.ts`, and a linked `node_modules/.bin/continuo`. So the diagnosis is exact and the fix
is one line.

**continuo's gate has already refused that line, and for this reason.** `continuo D-0045` rejects
the git-dependency shape outright and chooses `prepack` over `prepare` in its own words:

> `prepack` is deliberately **not** `prepare`: `prepare` is what npm runs when a *consumer*
> installs a git dependency, and adding it would collide with `D-0009`'s `--ignore-scripts` install
> policy.

That is a decision taken before this measurement existed, and the measurement below independently
reproduces the fact it rests on. Asking continuo for `prepare` would be asking it to reverse a
decision on evidence it already has, so it is **not** on the escalation list; option (a) is closed
at continuo's end, not merely unimplemented at rondo's.

Here is that fact, measured for this entry on a minimal package built for the purpose:

```
npm install --ignore-scripts "git+file://<scratch>/lib#4bfbce7"   ->  added 1 package in 600ms
ls node_modules/prepare-probe-lib/                                ->  dist  package.json
node -e 'import("prepare-probe-lib")...'                          ->  import ok: 1
```

**`--ignore-scripts` does not suppress a git dependency's `prepare` on npm 10.9.2.** The upstream
build ran and produced `dist/` under the flag whose entire purpose is to stop upstream code
executing on install (D-0007). A git dependency on continuo would therefore run continuo's build in
rondo's CI *despite* rondo's install policy. The fix and the hazard are the same line — which is
what `continuo D-0045` says, reached from continuo's side and confirmed here from rondo's.

### Option (b) — a workspace or `file:` link to the sibling checkouts: **partial for continuo, fails for cadenza**

The default `file:` form is a symlink, not a copy. `"private": true` does not block it, and with no
`prepare` nothing is built:

```
node_modules/@suisya-systems/continuo -> /home/happy_ryo/work/org/workers/continuo
```
```
FAIL @suisya-systems/continuo: ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND ... /dist/index.js
FAIL @suisya-systems/cadenza:  ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package ... /index.js
```

It also installs none of the target's own dependencies — `npm ls` reports `UNMET DEPENDENCY
better-sqlite3@13.0.3` and eight more — because the link expects the target to carry its own
`node_modules`.

Two refinements were tried, and neither saves the option:

- **`--install-links`** (or `install-links=true` in `.npmrc`, needing no change in either sibling)
  makes npm copy rather than symlink, installs the target's dependencies for real, and turns the
  dangling-target case into a loud `ENOENT` at exit 254 instead of a silent success. It does not
  make continuo importable: it *packs* the target, and `files: ["dist"]` with no `prepare` packs
  three files. The install prints `added 6 packages ... found 0 vulnerabilities` and the import
  still dies on `dist/index.js` — a nastier failure than the symlink form, because it looks
  correct.
- **npm workspaces** hit `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')` in arborist
  `#loadPeerSet` on npm 10.9.2, installed fine from a committed lockfile, and worked under npm
  12.0.2. That crash is **not a property of the workspace form**: it is the same arborist bug that
  any fresh `npm install` of rondo's own manifest hits on that npm (D-0007 records it from the
  other side), so it is a toolchain fact that happened to be met here rather than evidence about
  workspaces. The actual blocker is structural: workspaces require the sibling sources to live
  *inside* the rondo checkout.

The decisive property is the lockfile. A `file:` dependency records a path and nothing else —
`"resolved": "../../../../home/happy_ryo/work/org/workers/continuo", "link": true` — with no
registry URL, no integrity and no commit sha, so *which revision this was built against is recorded
nowhere in the repository*. And it fails silently in the direction that matters:

```
npm ci --ignore-scripts        # with the target directory renamed away
```
```
added 1 package, and audited 3 packages in 2s
found 0 vulnerabilities
```

Green install, dangling symlink, failure deferred to the first import. A CI runner holding only the
rondo repository cannot satisfy this option in any form, and the path is machine-specific and
Linux-shaped against a matrix that includes Windows.

### Option (c) — driving continuo across a CLI process boundary: **works for continuo, does not exist for cadenza**

Measured on an out-of-tree copy (`tar --exclude=.git`, 14 MB; the real checkout was never built
in), and reproduced independently from a fresh anonymous `git clone --depth 1`:

```
npm ci --ignore-scripts    ->  136 packages in ~4s
npm run build              ->  exit 0 in <1s  (tsc 7.0.2 + six scripts/copy-*.mjs, all succeeded)
node dist/cli.js --help    ->  eight subcommand families, exit 0
continuo db create         ->  opened a real SQLite control plane
```

`better-sqlite3@13.0.3` needs no native compile: it ships `prebuilds/` for all eight platform pairs
including `win32-x64` and declares no `install`/`postinstall`, so `--ignore-scripts` is safe and the
ubuntu+windows matrix needs no build toolchain.

For **cadenza there is nothing to spawn**, in either of its languages. The TypeScript half has no
`bin`, no build script, and `"noEmit": true` with no `tsconfig.build.json`; no file under `src/`
carries a shebang or a main-module guard. The Python half — `src/cadenza/`, 20 modules with a
setuptools `pyproject.toml` — has no `[project.scripts]`, no `__main__.py`, no `argparse` and no
`sys.argv`. Option (c) does not exist for cadenza, and no consumer-side flag creates it.

### Option (d) — the GitHub codeload tarball specifier: **works for continuo, and is the runner-up**

This one was not in the Issue's list. It was found by adversarially trying to refute option (a)'s
verdict, and it is the only route that consumes continuo *as a package* today with continuo
byte-for-byte unchanged:

```
npm install --ignore-scripts "https://github.com/suisya-systems/continuo/archive/9212f2b....tar.gz"
  ->  added 6 packages, exit 0
./node_modules/.bin/tsc -p node_modules/@suisya-systems/continuo/tsconfig.build.json
  ->  exit 0, dist/ created
node node_modules/@suisya-systems/continuo/scripts/copy-{migrations,spike-schema,roles-document,fence-hook,role-schema,canary-schema}.mjs
  ->  all six succeeded
node -e 'import("@suisya-systems/continuo")'   ->  ok 814
```

A remote-tarball dependency is **not** filtered by `"files"`, so the full working tree arrives —
`src/`, `scripts/`, `tsconfig.build.json` — and the lockfile carries a **real, enforced** integrity
hash with no `npm warn skipping integrity check`. On reproducibility it is strictly better than
every other option here.

It is not chosen for lap 1 for three reasons, in order of weight. It makes rondo **responsible for
building a dependency it does not own**, by name: the exact `tsc -p` invocation and the six copy
scripts are continuo's internal build, reproduced in rondo's repository, and they break silently
when continuo's build changes. It requires rondo to **carry `typescript@7.0.2` as a runtime concern**
of installation rather than a dev tool. And the build cannot be a `postinstall` — that *is*
suppressed by `--ignore-scripts` (measured) — so it becomes an explicit step every developer and
every CI job must remember, whose omission produces the same silent-green-then-crash shape option
(a) has.

### Why (c), stated against (d)

Both work. (d) answers provenance better and (c) answers ownership better, and ownership wins for
lap 1: rondo is a skeleton whose first job is to not acquire commitments it cannot honour. Under
(c) the coupling is a documented CLI and an exit-code convention; under (d) it is continuo's
internal build layout, reproduced in rondo, with no compatibility contract at all. (c) is also what
cadenza's design reached for the same seam from a different direction (`cadenza C-8`), which is
weak evidence but not zero.

### What (c) costs, stated plainly

- **No types across the seam.** rondo gets prose on stdout and an exit code, not `Run`, `Gate` or
  `Fence` types. At the pinned sha, `--json` is declared in exactly three places —
  `src/attention/cli.ts` (`attention scan`), and twice in `src/settings/cli.ts`, on
  `settings show --explain` and on `sandbox doctor`. Not on `settings generate`. So every verb a
  host would actually drive — `run`, `lap`, `gate`, `db`, `measure` — answers in English
  sentences, and only the exit-code convention (0 success, 2 refusal) is dependable.
- **Provenance is rondo's problem.** `continuo --version` prints the compile-time literal `0.0.0`
  (`src/about.ts`) for every revision on `main`, so the seam is silent about which continuo this
  is. rondo records the checkout's sha itself. This is `cadenza C-14`, owned in full rather than
  inherited from a version range.
- **~103 ms per invocation** (measured over 10 runs of `db verify`): Node startup, the native
  addon load, and opening the database. Fine for operator-cadence verbs; poor for anything rondo
  would poll or render live.
- **A second checkout and a second build** on every developer machine and in every CI job that
  needs continuo, keyed on the continuo sha.
- `dist/cli.js` lands mode 644 with a shebang and no exec bit, so it is spawned as
  `node <path>`, never relied on as a bin link.

### What publication changes

`continuo D-0045` is the event this entry is waiting for. When continuo is published, the
dependency becomes an ordinary pinned version: `npm view` resolves, the tarball is an immutable
published artifact with an *enforced* integrity hash, `prepare` never runs on the consumer because
the publisher builds, `--ignore-scripts` regains its meaning, `files` is applied at publish time,
and types cross the seam. At that point this entry is **superseded**, not amended.

Note that the packaging work publication needs — a build script, an `exports` map, a `files` list
for cadenza — is the same work options (a) and (b) needed. It is not wasted either way.

### Escalated, not made

Neither sibling was modified. The changes each would need, named precisely so cadenza's and
continuo's own gates can weigh them:

- **cadenza** `package.json`: an `exports` map (continuo's shape:
  `{".": {"types": "./dist/index.d.ts", "default": "./dist/index.js"}}`), a `"build"` script, a
  `"files"` list, and a new `tsconfig.build.json` with `noEmit: false`. Today cadenza has no entry
  point of any kind, which is why every option fails for it.
- **continuo**: *nothing about `prepare`.* It is the one change that would make option (a) work and
  `continuo D-0045` has already refused it, on the ground this entry independently measured. The
  escalation would be a request to un-decide something, which is not what an escalation is for.
- **continuo** `src/about.ts` / `src/cli.ts`: make `--version` carry the build's git revision, or
  add a `build-info --json` subcommand, so `cadenza C-14` is answerable across the seam rather than
  out of band.
- **continuo**: `--json` on the subcommands a host actually drives (`run admit`, `run close`,
  `lap perform`, `gate list`/`show`/`answer`, `db`).

### What would falsify it

- **continuo is published** (`continuo D-0045`). This is the expected end, not a surprise.
- **continuo grows a machine-readable surface** — `--json` on the driven subcommands and a
  `--version` that moves — at which point (c)'s two worst costs are gone and the entry should be
  re-argued on its merits rather than superseded by default.
- **cadenza acquires an entry point.** Then rondo has a decision to take about cadenza that it
  does not have today, and it is a new entry rather than an edit to this one.
- Any measurement above failing to reproduce. Every command is here so that it can be re-run; the
  toolchain it was taken on is `node v22.17.0` / `npm 10.9.2`, and npm's behaviour around
  `prepare`, `--install-links` and workspace resolution is version-dependent in ways this entry
  documents rather than assumes.

## D-0002 — The TypeScript configuration: ESM, NodeNext, strictness beyond `strict`, and no build output yet

**Status:** accepted (2026-09-05, rondo#1)

**Decision.** ESM (`"type": "module"`), `module` and `moduleResolution` both `NodeNext`, explicit
`.js` suffixes on every relative import, `strict` plus `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and
`exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, and `noEmit: true` with no build configuration.

**Why the module settings are a decision and not a default.** rondo will consume continuo and
cadenza, both of which resolve modules this way. A host that resolved differently from the
libraries it consumes is a class of bug that costs one line to avoid on an empty tree and a rewrite
of every import to fix later. The `.js` suffix is the visible half of that choice, and
`test/architecture/import-boundaries.test.ts` enforces it: a relative import without a runtime
extension is a violation, so the convention cannot decay one file at a time.

**Why the two extra strictness flags.** Neither is implied by `strict`, and both are the kind of
thing that is free now and expensive after a suite exists.
`noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is what makes an index into a record an `| undefined` the reader has to
answer for, which is most of what a store layer does. `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` is what keeps
"absent" and "present and undefined" from being the same value, which is most of what a wire
protocol does. rondo will do both.

**Why no build output.** rondo is the host application, not a library: nothing consumes a `dist/`
of it. Adding an emitting configuration now would mean maintaining a build that nothing checks and
nothing installs. The day rondo ships a binary is the day it earns an entry of its own.

**One known hole, kept deliberately.** `@types/node` is pinned at `26.3.0`, which is newer than
either runtime rondo supports, so a Node 26-only API — `crypto.randomUUIDv7()` is the example —
type-checks here and is `undefined` on Node 22. Typing against the *oldest* supported runtime would
close that. It is not done, because continuo and cadenza both pin `26.3.0` and three repositories
that disagree about their Node types is a worse problem than one shared hole: a type that resolves
differently in the host and the library it consumes is exactly the class of bug the module settings
above exist to avoid. The mitigation is that the Windows and Node 22 cells *run* the suite, so an
API that does not exist on 22 fails there. Revisit when the siblings do, and revisit sooner if any
`src/` module starts calling a Node API that is not obviously ancient.

**What would falsify it.** rondo becoming something another package imports — which would mean
`C-17` had been re-decided — or the sibling packages settling on a different resolution mode when
they are published. Or the `@types/node` hole above biting for real, in which case the answer is
the oldest-runtime pin and a note in the siblings' repositories.

## D-0003 — The double-green rule, and where it is enforced

**Status:** accepted (2026-09-05, rondo#1)

**Decision.** Test order is shuffled on both axes (file order and, within a file, test order), and
CI runs the suite **twice per matrix cell with two distinct seeds**, both derived from the run id,
the attempt and the cell coordinates, and both printed. An unset `RONDO_TEST_SEED` under `CI` is a
hard error.

**Where each half lives, and why the split is the point.** The shuffle is configured in
`vitest.config.ts` and is **not** passed on the command line; CI injects the seed and nothing else.
A CLI flag can be deleted by an edit to a workflow file without a single test turning red, which
would retire the rule silently — the worst way to lose a guarantee, because the gate stays green
while it happens. Putting the shuffle in the config file means removing it is a diff in the file
whose whole subject is how tests run.

The seed requirement is the other half. A run whose seed was implicit cannot be replayed, so an
order-dependent failure in it is unactionable — and so is an order-dependent *success*, which is
the case people forget: the seed of a green run is what a later bisect needs. Hence the seed is
printed on success as well as failure.

**Two seeds, not two runs.** Equality between the derived seeds is astronomically unlikely and is
still handled explicitly, because "two runs at the same seed" is exactly the degenerate case that
would void the guarantee while looking like it held.

**And no retries.** `retry: 0`. A test that passes on the second attempt under a shuffled order is
precisely the signal this rule exists to surface.

**What would falsify it.** A suite whose runtime makes two full runs per cell expensive — rondo's
is currently under a second — or a source of order dependence that the shuffle cannot reach, at
which point the rule is not wrong but is no longer sufficient.

---

## D-0004 — ASCII-only for anything rondo prints

**Status:** accepted (2026-09-05, rondo#1)

**Decision.** Every string rondo writes to a terminal — `--help` text, log lines, error messages,
the test-seed line in `vitest.config.ts` — is ASCII. This does not apply to comments, Markdown,
identifiers, or test names.

**Why.** CI includes a Windows cell, where the console may be cp932. A character that cannot be
encoded there does not print badly: it raises `UnicodeEncodeError` in the writer and takes the
process with it. The failure is invisible in a normal test run, because vitest captures stdout
through a UTF-8 path — so the suite is green and the real terminal crashes. An em dash in a help
string is enough.

The rule is cheap and total, which is why it is a rule rather than a review habit: "use ASCII in
program output" needs no judgement at the point of writing, and "check whether this character
survives cp932" needs one every time.

**What would falsify it.** The Windows cell leaving the matrix, or a measurement showing the
runner's console is UTF-8 in every configuration rondo is run in — which would still leave
operators' consoles, so the bar is higher than CI alone.

---

## D-0005 — One module owns SQLite, and the driver is `node:sqlite`

**Status:** accepted (2026-09-05, rondo#1)

**Decision.** `src/store/sqlite.ts` is the only module in the repository allowed to name a SQLite
driver. `test/architecture/import-boundaries.test.ts` asserts that the set of modules importing one
is *exactly* `{src/store/sqlite.ts}` — equality, not containment — and grants the driver's bindings
per module rather than per layer, so a second file in `src/store/` cannot open its own connection
either. The driver is `node:sqlite`.

**Why an owner at all.** The store is the one part of rondo whose replacement is foreseeable — the
schema is undecided, and `cadenza C-16` and continuo's control plane both have opinions about
durable state that rondo has not yet had to reconcile. A single owning module is what makes that
replacement a diff in one file rather than an archaeology exercise, and it is only true if
something enforces it from the first commit, before there is anything to migrate.

**Why `node:sqlite` rather than `better-sqlite3`.** It is in the standard library of both Node
versions rondo supports, so the boundary costs no dependency, no lockfile entry, and no prebuilt
binary on the Windows cell. The cost, which is real: Node still marks it experimental. That is
acceptable *because* of the boundary this entry draws — swapping the driver touches one file, and
the test that would catch a second owner is the same test that makes the swap safe.

The `SQLITE_DRIVERS` set in the boundary test names the native and WASM packages too, not only the
one in use, because the claim is about the database rather than about a library: changing drivers
must not be a way to acquire a second owner.

**What would falsify it.** `node:sqlite` proving inadequate — a missing feature, or an
experimental-API break across 22 and 24 — in which case the driver changes and the ownership does
not. Or a design in which rondo does not own durable state at all, which would be a much larger
decision than this one.

## D-0006 — The import boundary is a test that parses the tree, not a lint rule

**Status:** accepted (2026-09-05, rondo#1)

**Decision.** The dependency direction of `src/` is enforced by
`test/architecture/import-boundaries.test.ts`, which reads each module's text and asks a TypeScript
parser what it imports. It is stated as **allowlists** — what each layer may import, and what each
module may import from outside the package — and it is guarded against passing vacuously in three
independent ways.

**Why a test rather than a lint rule.** Three properties, none of which a lint rule gives:

1. **It runs in the gate the same way everything else does**, with the same failure output, and it
   cannot be disabled by a config key or an inline suppression comment. A boundary that a
   `// biome-ignore` can cross is not a boundary.
2. **It can assert about the tree as a whole**, not file by file. "Exactly one module imports a
   SQLite driver" and "every module under `src/` is classified" are claims about the set of
   modules; a per-file rule cannot state either.
3. **Its own detector is testable.** `PLANTED` is a corpus of hand-written violating modules
   attributed to paths that do not exist on disk, each of which the detector must catch, beside
   clean controls it must not flag. That is what makes the check itself falsifiable rather than
   trusted.

**Why parsed, never imported.** An import inside a function body, in type position, through a
re-export, via `require`, via `import x = require()`, in an `import("...")` type node, or in a
triple-slash directive is still an import for the purpose of a boundary. Importing the tree would
see none of them — and would also run it.

**Why an allowlist over imports is not sufficient on its own.**
`process.getBuiltinModule("node:http")` takes a module without importing anything, because
`process` is a global — so an allowlist consulted only on imports would never be consulted at all,
and the loop's "empty allowance" would have been empty in the wrong sense. The sweep therefore also
reads calls that return a module (`require`, `getBuiltinModule`, `createRequire`, matched on the
callee's *last name segment* so a member expression does not evade it) and calls that turn text
into code (`eval`, the `Function` constructor), and runs both through the same allowance -- and
refuses a bare *read* of those names, because `const load = process.getBuiltinModule` moves the
call out of reach of any check on callees. The read check runs in **value position only**, which is
what lets `Function` be refused as `const compile = Function` and allowed as `let handler:
Function`: a type annotation names something without reaching it, and the walk carries a
type-position flag so that the same identifier can have opposite answers. A member name that is computed rather than written
(`process["get" + "BuiltinModule"]`) is refused for the same reason: whether it named a capability
is exactly the question, so the answer is no.

**And `src/` is TypeScript, enforced.** The walk finds `.js`, `.mjs` and `.cjs` modules there in
order to refuse them. Two things are wrong with one: `allowJs` is off, so nothing type-checks it;
and a JSDoc `@type {import("node:http").Server}` in it is a real dependency hanging off a node the
tree walk does not traverse. Teaching the sweep to read JSDoc would close the second; refusing the
file closes both, and whatever the next JavaScript-only affordance turns out to be. Nothing is
lost, because the tree has no such module and no reason to grow one.

**Some capabilities are not modules.** `fetch("https://...")` is HTTP, needs no import, and is not
a module reference, so the allowlist has nothing to consult about it. Enforcing "the loop must not
import HTTP" against `import` alone would enforce the letter of the rule and miss the likeliest way
a loop would really make a request, so a small closed set of ambient names -- `fetch`, `WebSocket`,
`EventSource`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `navigator` -- is refused across all of `src/`. This one is an
enumeration rather than an allowlist, which is a weakness and is recorded as one: there is no
"everything ambient" to invert. An access point that needs `fetch` gets an explicit exception, and
adding it is a decision.

**What this check does not claim, stated because five review rounds went looking for it.** It is a
sweep over syntax, so its guarantee is over what a module *says*. One residual is known and left
open on purpose: a capability reached through an identifier-keyed index --
`const k = "getBuiltinModule"; const load = process[k]` -- cannot be seen here, because deciding
what `k` holds is scope analysis. Refusing every computed index instead would refuse every array
subscript in the tree, which is the worse trade. The line drawn is between a member name that is
*indexed* (`row[key]`, allowed) and one that is *assembled* (`process["get" + "X"]`, refused). The
result stops mistakes and records intent; it does not stop an author set on getting around it, and
no syntax sweep does. The second residual is the ambient one above: a capability that reaches the
world without naming a module and is not in the enumerated set is invisible here.

**Why allowlists.** A denylist answers "no" only for what it was told about. `src/refrain/`'s
external allowance is empty, which refuses `node:http`, a browser driver, an agent SDK, continuo's
internals, and the next thing nobody has thought of, in one line. The same shape closes the routes
that would otherwise need enumerating one at a time: a namespace import, a default import, a
side-effect import, a `require`, a dynamic `import()` and a computed specifier all reduce to a
sentinel that cannot appear in an allowlist, so all six fail closed rather than being named.

**The vacuity problem, and the three answers.** The per-module cases are generated from a directory
walk, and a walk that found nothing would generate nothing — and a suite of zero assertions is
green. So: the walk has its own case with a floor (`EXPECTED_MODULES`); every discovered module
must be classified or explicitly named unlayered; and `PLANTED` exercises the detector in both
directions. Beyond the file, CI's `boundary-is-not-vacuous` job writes a *real* violating module to
`src/refrain/` and requires the suite to go **red** — the one check that can catch a mistake in the
anti-vacuity machinery itself. Measured on this commit, that planted module produces:

```
src/refrain/planted-violation.ts imports the external module node:http, which it is not granted.
src/refrain/planted-violation.ts imports ../access/local.js (-> src/access/local.js), which is outside its allowance [src/refrain, src/store].
```

**What would falsify it.** A lint rule acquiring set-level assertions and un-suppressibility, or
the sweep's runtime becoming significant — it currently spawns one compiler child process for the
whole file and finishes in under 300 ms.

## D-0007 — Install from the lockfile, with `--ignore-scripts`

**Status:** accepted (2026-09-05, rondo#1)

**Decision.** Every CI job installs with `npm ci --ignore-scripts`. `package-lock.json` is
committed and is the pinned build input. `.npmrc` sets `save-exact=true`.

**Why `npm ci`.** It fails when `package.json` and `package-lock.json` disagree, so a dependency
cannot drift into a run without appearing in a diff. `npm install` resolves afresh and can quietly
choose differently on two machines. There is also a local reason, recorded because it costs an hour
to rediscover: on npm 10.9.2 a fresh `npm install` in this repository fails outright with
`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'edgesOut')` — an arborist crash resolving vitest's peer
set. `npm ci` reifies from the lockfile and never takes that path.

**Why `--ignore-scripts`, as a standing rule.** It is not a reaction to a particular package. It is
the property that upstream code does not execute merely because something was installed. rondo's
current dependency set needs no install scripts at all, which is the cheapest time to adopt the
rule.

**What the rule does not cover, and this is the interesting part.** Measured for D-0001:
`--ignore-scripts` does **not** suppress a *git dependency's* `prepare` on npm 10.9.2 — the
upstream build ran and produced `dist/` under the flag. So the flag's guarantee holds for registry
dependencies and is void for git ones. That is one of the reasons D-0001 declines a git dependency
on continuo, and it is recorded here because someone reading only this entry would otherwise
believe the guarantee is total.

**What would falsify it.** npm changing either behaviour, or a dependency that genuinely cannot
work without an install script — at which point the exception is named in this file rather than
taken by dropping the flag.

## D-0008 — Biome, knip, and what `npm run verify` means

**Status:** accepted (2026-09-05, rondo#1)

**Decision.** Biome is the linter *and* the formatter, run as one command (`biome check`), so a
formatting difference is a red gate rather than a warning. knip runs over the same tree and fails
on unused exports and unused dependencies. `npm run verify` is exactly
`lint && knip && typecheck && test`, and it is the whole of local verification.

**Why one tool for lint and format.** Two tools means a file can satisfy each of them and neither
of their intersections, and it means two configurations that can disagree about line width. Biome
does both from one config at one speed.

**Why knip on a repository this small.** Precisely because it is small. rondo's `src/` is six
modules whose only consumer is a barrel, so an export that stops being reachable is invisible by
inspection and obvious to knip. The check costs nothing now and becomes hard to adopt later, once
there is a backlog of dead exports to triage.

**Why `verify` is one script.** So that "did you check?" has one answer. Splitting it invites a
contributor to run the fast half.

**What would falsify it.** A suite slow enough that a single `verify` is no longer something a
contributor runs before every commit, at which point the split is a decision to take deliberately
rather than by drift.
