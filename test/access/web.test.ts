/**
 * The operator's page, over a real store.
 *
 * Against `node:sqlite` rather than a stub for `between.test.ts`'s reason: the
 * one property worth asserting here is that a surface which draws itself every
 * few seconds writes **nothing** -- and "no row was written" is a claim about a
 * database rather than about a mock's call log. The one write it may do is
 * asserted the other way round, against a recorded call, because what is under
 * test there is the door rather than the ledger: `answerFromPage` is the
 * command line's own `walkGate` and `resume`, and this file has no continuo.
 * The half of that press which *is* a ledger write -- the framing it rests on
 * (D-0042) -- is asserted against the database, because it is reachable without
 * one. The other two are what the
 * terminal got wrong and this page must not (rondo#90's paragraphs, rondo#91's
 * repeated basis), and both are properties of the bytes that reach a browser.
